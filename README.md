# Welcome!

I'm Magdalena Wojcieszak, a Professor at UC Davis and an Associate Researcher at the University of Amsterdam. Together with my wonderful Team (see our photos below), we are inviting you to participate in a study that is part of an international research project (ERC EXPO). We want to understand people’s opinions and how they use YouTube. 

## Why?
YouTube is a very popular and widely used platform. Knowing how people use it and what types of videos they watched is very important. We commit to protecting your confidentiality and privacy during our research.  

## What?
To understand how you use YouTube, we ask you to install a plug-in on your computer. The plug-in will be activated once you start using YouTube and record what videos you visit (just the URL, not the content). 

## Important:
We do not collect any other information, only the YouTube videos you watch. Please note that your experience of YouTube may slightly change during these three weeks due to our study. It should not, however, interfere with your user experience. 
Our extension is not a black-box owned by a company or a corporation. We have created it ourselves at UC Davis and are committed to open-sourcing it at the end of our research. Our project is motivated by transparency, open access, and highest research principles.
Our research is in accordance with the highest ethical guidelines and standards and has been approved by the Ethical Review Board of the University of Amsterdam and also of the European Research Council. All the information about privacy can be found here [HERE LINK TO THE PRIVACY TAB OF OUR PAGE] 
How? 
The study will last 3 weeks. Today, you are asked to complete a short survey (about 5 minutes) and install our Chrome extension. In three weeks, we will ask you to complete another short survey (about 5 minutes). If you participate, you will receive $3 for installing our Chrome extension and taking the first short survey. In addition, if you have the extension installed for 3 weeks and you take the second survey in 3 weeks, you’ll be paid an additional $15. 
If you do not install the plug-in, you will not be able to take part in this study
You can only take each survey once

## Who?
A lot of people… among others:
- Software development (browser extension) developed by Muhammad Haroon 
- Informed consent and privacy policies developed by Ericka Menchen Trevino & Magdalena Wojcieszak 
- Questionnaire and study development and designed by the entire Team
